Scales are an excellent way to practice coordination. In "Mastering Scales" I
have written out scales in each possible key.

## Mastering Scales. Vol 1

- Scales over one octave
- Triads in two octaves
- Good for beginners
- Good for low intensity practice

See the booklet's Preface for more information.
