title: Daily Practice Schedule
---

A serious student should practice three to four hours a day[^practice-quantity].
Here is one way to help you jugle the different areas of work.

[^practice-quantity]: See an article about practice quantity.



## A two-session day

08:00-09:30 Session #1 (Playing duration: 60-90 mins)

11:00-19:00 Lunch, Rest, Dinner, Other commitments

19:00-21:00 Session #2 (Playing duration: 60-90 mins)

I do not recommend squeezing 4 hours of practicing into two sessions.


## A three-session day

08:00-09:30 Session #1 (Playing duration: 60-90 mins)

09:30-10:00 Rest

10:00-11:15 Session #2 (Playing duration: 30-60 mins)

11:00-19:00 Lunch, Rest, Dinner, Other commitments

19:00-21:00 Session #3 (Playing duration: 60-90 mins)

## Session #1

1. Warm up (2-5 min)
  - Low intensity
2. Flexibility (~10 min)
  - Low intensity, building up to medium intensity
3. Stability (~10 min)
  - Low intensity Long tones
4. Mobility (~10 min)
  - Scales, Clarke
5. Rest (2-5 min)





## Important considerations

- Spread the sessions throughout the day.
- Plan sufficient rest and try to be well rested for each session.

## On Rest


There are many ways of structuring schedule.
